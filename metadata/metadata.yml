name: Physics-based Priors for Gaussian Process Phase Classification in Alloy Design
description: 'Alloy design can be framed as a constraint-satisfaction problem (Abu
  Odeh et al., 2018). Building on previous methodologies (Vela et al., 2023), we propose
  equipping Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPCs) with physics-informed prior mean functions
  to model the boundaries of feasible design spaces. Through three case studies, we
  highlight the utility of informative priors for handling constraints on continuous
  and categorical properties. 1) Phase Stability: By incorporating CALPHAD predictions
  as priors for solid-solution phase stability, we enhance model validation using
  an augmented XRD dataset (Machaka et al., 2021). 2) Phase Stability Prediction Refinement:
  We demonstrate an in silico active learning approach to efficiently correct phase
  diagrams. 3) Continuous Property Thresholds: By embedding priors into continuous
  property models, we accelerate the discovery of alloys meeting specific property
  thresholds via active learning. In each case, integrating physics-based insights
  into the classification framework substantially improved model performance, demonstrating
  an efficient strategy for constraint-aware alloy design.'
